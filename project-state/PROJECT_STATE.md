# Project State

## Current Goal

Prepare for `TASK-004_TELEGRAM_PREVIEW` review after completing the Workflow DSL, Runtime Core, and API Test Loop foundations.

## Current Reality

`flowai-platform` exists. TASK-000 is done for skeleton/setup. TASK-001 is done for workflow-dsl after review and revision. TASK-002 is done for runtime-core after implementation revision and verification. TASK-003 is done for the API test loop after implementation revision and verification. The current accepted operating mode is task-first.

Telegram, WhatsApp, crawling, RAG, AI providers, durable persistence, auth, tenants, billing, Studio UI, and exporters are not accepted or implemented by TASK-003.

## Active Decisions

- FlowAI is a Business-to-Workflow Chatbot Generator.
- Old backend is reference-only.
- Skill/MCP Readiness Check is required before every task.
- Workflow JSON DSL is source of truth.
- Runtime core interprets validated Workflow JSON safely and channel-neutrally.
- Runtime proof comes before generator/crawling/UI.
- Telegram preview comes before WhatsApp.
- Channels are adapters, not workflow owners.
- No executable workflow code.
- No unsafe OSS copying.
- Workflow DSL validator is dependency-free for now.
- `handoff` and `end` are terminal runtime nodes.
- Runtime `ai_response` and `rag_answer` are deterministic placeholders only.
- API test loop exposes only health, workflow validation, in-memory runtime start/message/trace/reset.
- API test loop uses `stateSummary` and safe structured errors for test/debug flows.

## Active Risks

- Agents may overbuild without following task files.
- Future AI/RAG/channel work may be claimed before it is tested.
- Manual DSL validation may become harder to maintain if DSL scope expands.
- API runtime test sessions are process-local, temporary, capped in memory, lost on restart, not tenant-safe, and not horizontally scalable.

## Protected Areas

- Do not copy code from legacy backend, Dify, Typebot, Firecrawl, or unsafe-license projects.
- Do not add `eval`, `new Function`, arbitrary workflow expressions, or secrets in workflow JSON.
- Do not implement crawling, Telegram, WhatsApp, Studio UI, RAG, or AI generation without explicit task approval.

## Next Recommended Action

Start `TASK-004_TELEGRAM_PREVIEW` with a review-only pass first. Do not assume any Telegram/channel prototype is accepted until reviewed.
